# PyTorch Geography Segmentation Project

This project attempts to develop a Convolutional Neural Network with PyTorch with inspiration taken from the popular UNet encoder-decoder network architecture designed to assist with instance segmentation originally designed to improve medical imaging techniques for the detection of cancerous tumors!

This project builds the UNet architecture from scratch using PyTorch and OpenCV and implements multi-class instance segmentation on the Landcover.ai dataset of satellite images collected over Poland with masks provided for 4 class labels -- forestry, roads, buildings, farmland. The Landcover.ai dataset can be accessed here: [Landcover.ai homepage](https://landcover.ai.linuxpolska.com/).
